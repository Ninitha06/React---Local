Assumption : expo-cli and nodeJS installed during class and is working fine in your machine.

1. Go to the folder in which you work (whitehat project folder)
(eg) cd c:\Ninitha\students
2. expo init BuzzerApp
3. Choose blank template
4. Whenever you plan to use libraries other than react and react-native, install them using
npm install.
(eg) expo install react-navigation.
Use npm install react-navigation@4.1.0 if you want to install a particular version of react native.

5. Check if an entry is created in package.json file.
6. Write your code
7. expo start in command prompt. 
If you want to clear cache, use expo start -c
(Since we clear cache, this will take time initially but better than to face issues).
Note : If you face any issues like unable to resolve module "XXXXX" .. it means that module has to be installed
using expo install or npm install commands. Press Ctrl + C, install the module and then again do expo start to check your output.
8. Scan the QR Code in LAN mode if using same Wifi.
9. Switch to Tunnel if you are in different networks.
10. Within few minutes, you should be able to see Building Javascript Bundle in your command prompt or 
localhost window. If not, refresh the expo Go in your mobile, clear your memory consumption in phone and try again.
11. You can do your coding with the output in mobile which gets refreshed automatically(hot reloading). 
Sometimes, you might have to refresh manually. But after some time, Chrome browser might get heavy and hang.. 
So do stop the metro bundler at regular intervals using Ctrl+C.

Press Ctrl + C to exit command prompt running expo... Then you can close command prompt or type exit.
